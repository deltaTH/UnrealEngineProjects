# UnrealEngineProjects

Here are few projects that I have made during using Unreal Engine 4 and 5.

## Project 1 : Learning Basics

This project was created on Unreal Engine 4 and is divided into 2 levels.

In the first level : 
- I have created foilage.
- I have created land with different textures, creast and trough.
- A room which has
  ```sh
   -- ceiling which breathes light.
   -- a mirror
   -- a window through which sun rays can enter in the room
  ```
- Drugged Environment : The environment makes the player feel like the player is on drugs.
- The house has a staircase attached to it that takes the player to the rooftop.
- The rooftop contains a table and an Unreal logo and also a bench to sit on.
- The foilage around our map has also chairs spawned all over the foilage.

In the second level : 
- We have a shiny metallic ball present on the level with us. When the player touches this ball, the player caughts fire and start burning.
- This can be used in a real game scenario when a player touches any game object, then some kind of powerup happens to the player.

## Project 2 : Sun Temple - FPS shooter

[Project Link - Sun Temple Map](https://mmmutgkp-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/2020021003_mmmut_ac_in/EiyjIffTcSNJjWFv_lAiyUoBDAx6o4qVfvpaMMUTSP6jxA?e=1ZWBs1)

This game was created in Unreal Engine 5.
The game has two parts : 
- The first part is the part where all the magic happens. In the first part I have created Bulleye boards all across the level for the player to shoot down.
- The player moves through the level and shoots down the boards.

In the second part : 
- The whole game is the implemented in the Sun Temple map from the Unreal Library.
- The Bullseye points are set across the whole level at different points.
- The player has to find all the boards withing the time limit and shoot them down.

The tutorial I followed was based on UE4 but I was making the project on UE5, there were some hiccups here and there but I Went throught all the errors. But in the last part of the tutorial I realised that the player is not spawning with the gun in UE5 but was doing fine in UE4. Hence in our final game the gun is not present.
