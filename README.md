# UnrealEngineProjects

Here are few projects that I have made during using Unreal Engine 4 and 5.

## Project 1 : Learning Basics
[Project Link - Onedrive](https://mmmutgkp-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/2020021003_mmmut_ac_in/EpispFvPfpdFoUL9bI3DcGABUyw0VFq-yOLpPjWaeg-4LA?e=wICQre)
This project is divided into 2 levels.
In the first level : 
- I have created foilage.
- I have created land with different textures, creast and trough.
- A room which has
  -- ceiling which breathes light.
  -- a mirror
  -- a window thrugh which sun rays can enter in the room
- Drugged Environment : The environment makes the player feel like the player is on drugs.
- The house has a staircase attached to it that takes the player to the rooftop.
- The rooftop contains a table and an Unreal logo and also a bench to sit on.
- The foilage around our map has also chairs spawned all over the foilage.
